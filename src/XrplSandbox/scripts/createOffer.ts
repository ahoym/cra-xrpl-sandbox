/**
 * TODO:

 *    - Ascertain whether a trust set can be set once. Currently, multiple runs of this script
 *      will set a trust set every single time.
 *    - Ascertain whether a trust set is necessary for an account that isnt issued currencies (Client 3).
 *
 * - Disco more into offers, how one may be broken up given multiple buyers for a sell.
 *
 * - Disco offers using two issued currencies instead of XRP.
 *
 * - Disco "rippled" offers using XRP as the common conra asset.
